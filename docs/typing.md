# Typing

Types are optional: plain JavaScript gets the full API. To check channel values, declare each channel
once in the package's `Channels` interface:

```ts
// channels.d.ts
export {}; // keeps the file a module, so this adds to the package's types instead of replacing them

declare module '@softarc/native-federation-communication' {
  interface Channels {
    'cart:changed': { count: number };
    // command: emit with { retain: false }
    'ui:toast': { text: string };
  }
}
```

```ts
bus.emit('cart:changed', { count: 3 }); // ok
bus.emit('cart:changed', { cnt: 3 }); // error
bus.on('cart:changed', ({ count }) => {}); // count: number
```

Types apply to `bus` and `createBus()`. `globalThis.__NF_BUS__` stays untyped, because every copy of the
package declares it.

## In JavaScript

Keep the same `channels.d.ts` and start a `.js` file with `// @ts-check` (or set `checkJs` in
`jsconfig.json`). Your editor then completes channel names and flags wrong values. In JSDoc, name a
value type as `import('@softarc/native-federation-communication').ChannelValue<'cart:changed'>`.

## What the types don't catch

- **A misspelt name is just another channel.** It compiles, with an `unknown` value. Export the names as
  constants from your contracts module.
- **Augment the package name, never `'./domain'`.** Mixing the two in one app can silently drop
  declarations.
- **An undeclared channel is `unknown`**, not `any`: narrow the value before you use it, or cast it
  where you can see it: `bus.peek('legacy:cart') as Cart | undefined`.
- **A union of names takes a union of values.** With `name: 'cart:changed' | 'ui:toast'`,
  `bus.emit(name, value)` accepts either channel's value. Emit with a literal name.
- **Commands.** Mark them in the declaration, as above, and emit them through one typed helper:

  ```ts
  export const showToast = (toast: ChannelValue<'ui:toast'>): void =>
    bus.emit('ui:toast', toast, { retain: false });
  ```

- **Other deploys.** A deployed producer can still send a shape a deployed consumer doesn't expect.

## Typed handles

To name a channel once and get its value type from `Channels`, wrap it in a handle:

```ts
import {
  bus,
  type ChannelName,
  type ChannelValue,
  type EmitOptions,
  type OnOptions,
} from '@softarc/native-federation-communication';

export const channel = <K extends ChannelName>(name: K) => ({
  emit: (value: ChannelValue<K>, options?: EmitOptions) => bus.emit(name, value, options),
  on: (listener: (value: ChannelValue<K>) => void, options?: OnOptions) =>
    bus.on(name, listener, options),
  peek: () => bus.peek(name),
});
```

```ts
export const cartChanged = channel('cart:changed');
cartChanged.emit({ count: 3 });
cartChanged.on(({ count }) => {});
```

## Strict channel names

`bus` accepts any name, so a typo becomes a new channel. To make it a compile error, use a view that
only takes declared names:

```ts
import {
  bus,
  type Channels,
  type EmitOptions,
  type OnOptions,
  type Unsubscribe,
} from '@softarc/native-federation-communication';

// Accepts declared channels only, so a misspelt name is a compile error.
export type StrictBus = {
  emit<K extends keyof Channels>(channel: K, value: Channels[K], options?: EmitOptions): void;
  on<K extends keyof Channels>(
    channel: K,
    listener: (value: Channels[K]) => void,
    options?: OnOptions
  ): Unsubscribe;
  peek<K extends keyof Channels>(channel: K): Channels[K] | undefined;
};

export const strictBus = bus as StrictBus;
```

## Sharing the declarations

Every producer and consumer must see the declaration: put it in a types-only contracts package that
each remote includes, or copy the `.d.ts` into each repo (simpler, but copies drift). Two different
types for one channel are a compile error, which shows the drift at build time.

## Evolving a channel

- Name channels `team:subject:verb`, such as `checkout:cart:changed`, so ownership is clear.
- Use object values, even for one field, so you can add fields later.
- Make a breaking change under a new name, such as `cart:changed.v2`, and emit both until every
  consumer has moved.
